# testmark 

is a testmark -> markup parser. 

it parses markup for specific codeblocks beginning with a comment.
The string inside of this markup then can be used for documentation in your markup but aswell be used in testing software or other stuff.


inspired by [go-testmark](https://github.com/warpfork/go-testmark) - there is also **specification**.

## usage

```
pip install python-testmark

>>> from testmark import parse
>>> parse("path-to-file.md")
```

have fun and good testing and `eval`ing.
